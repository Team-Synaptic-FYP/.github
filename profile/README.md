# This organization contains 3 respositories, developed for a research based on DL-Based Lung Sound Classification With Accessibility

# DL-pipeline repo
This contains the entire deep learning pipeline used for audio pre processing, feature extraction, classification models and explainability.

# backend repo
This repo was developed to create the server for the mobile application. 
Our pretrained models were included in the flask backend. You can separately test the server with postman or the mobile app

# frontend repo
The repository consists the code for the front end mobile application that supports audio file uploads. 
The front end communicates with the backend to detect whether uploaded audio is healthy or abnormal. 
Further, a detailed breakdown for abnormal sounds to receive the top 3 disease diagnosis is also featured.

Separate readme files are included in the 3 repositories to run the code
